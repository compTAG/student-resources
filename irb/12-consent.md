A Waiver of Documentation of Consent must be approved by the IRB. One of the following criteria must be met:

1. The only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subjectâ€™s wishes will govern.
2. The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.

Provide justification for one of the above reasons to request this waiver.
