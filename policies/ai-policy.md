# CompTaG AI Use Policy

Under no circumstances should things that are not already publicly
accessible be put into any form of AI chat bot or product.

Any use of AI generated content should be disclosed up front.
And, be familiar with the rules and policies of venues to ensure you are
following their rules!

## Papers
- No AI-generated content. Writing should be your own.
- No AI-generated citations. Citations should be your own.
- It is recommended to use an AI tool to check for grammar/spelling issues.
However, this should only happen at the end (right before the paper is soon
going to enter the public domain anyway), and ensure you 
verify with co-authors first.
- AI can be a great tool to help find additional (although not exhaustive)
background research.
However, all synthesis and understanding should be your own.

## Code
- Any line of code written by an AI tool should be verified and understood by
you. You are ultimately responsible for any line of code written by you (or an
LLM you have used)
- AI tools can be a great way to assist you in learning a code base, programming
language, etc. However, remember that you cannot trust them blindly!

## Images
- Journal and conference requirements vary, so be sure to check if you are
allowed to use AI images or not.
- LLMs are faster at creating flyers for outreach events, and sketches as
placeholders for figures in papers (although hand drawn
sketches are always acceptable).
- To avoid potential copyright issues, its recommended to use a hand drawn
draft as input to the AI tool
