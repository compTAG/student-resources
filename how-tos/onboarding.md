# Welcome to CompTaG!

Welcome to the Computational Topology and Geometry (CompTaG) research group at
Montana State University! We are very excited to have you joining us! Below
you will find a variety of resources that will help you learn about the team
and become prepared to begin making contributions!

## Logistics

We have a one hour research seminar and writing workshops year-round, and a
summer weekly book club.  In addition, we schedule prove-a-thons, which is a
common time to work on research problems.  See slack for the updated meeitng
times. 

## Onboarding Tasks

1. Faculty Court 23. Our main meeting location isFaculty Court #23 (FC23).
   Graduate students can obtain a key by contacting Suzie Hockel or Brittany
   Fasy.  Snacks and sodas are available on an honor system cash payment in the
   kitchen. Please post in the slack channel #fc23 about your comings and goings
   to FC23.  If we go into Phase 2 restrictions again, FC23 will only be
   available with prior permission.

2. [Slack](https://tda-at-msu.slack.com/home): Most of the
   communication between team members occurs on Slack, which is a team
   collaboration software. Both web and mobile versions are available, and we
   encourage that you install Slack on your smartphone if possible. To be added
   to our Slack group, please ask Brittany Fasy or David Millman.

    * Post a message to #general to introduce yourself to the group!
    * Click on the word `Channels` and join any conversations that seem
      interesting to you.

3. GIT: if you are not yet familiar with git (or need a refresher), please take
   the GIT Udacity course:
    [Git Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
    or use the desktop learning app [Git-it](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/git-it).

4. Videos: To get started in the filed, please see the Introductory Readings
   and Videos
   for Topics sections of
   [README](https://github.com/compTAG/student-resources#introductory-readings-for-topics)
   page.  For a crash course on some specific topics, watch these videos:

    * Group theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4plQ5ppg9c&list=PLAvgI3H-gclb_Xy7eTIXkkKt3KlV6gk9_
    * Persistent Homology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bnG1Wavag&amp;t=16s
    * Topological Data Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOZN3XZdoO0
    * Computational Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuTHBkyLJ1k

5. Code: Papers (even theoretical ones) typically have an experimental section,
   which means that you should be comfortable running some code!  To get started, complete the following tasks:
    
    * Compute persistent homology of a triangle using [Dionysus](https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/)
    * Compute a Delaunay triangulation in  [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), and
     output the triangulation data structure.
    * Learn how to use the R TDA Package.
    * Complete the Hyalite training. Hyalite is the research computing cluster
      on campus. To schedule a training, please email Research Cyberinfrastructure
      at hyalite-support@montana.edu and copy Brittany Fasy and David
      Millman.

6. Team Papers: Our team has authored several papers that we encourage you to read in order to learn more about our work.  Write a short summary of the _problem_ beling addressed in each of the following papers (and post it in your perosnal git repo).
    
    * [Searching in the space of persistence diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11257)
    * [PHT-based reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12759)
    * [Fast randomized point location without preprocessing in two-and three-dimensional Delaunay triangulations (by Binhai and collabs)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772198000352)
    * [On the Bootstrap for Persistence Diagrams and Landscapes (by Brittany and collabs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0376)
    * [Parallel Geometric Algorithms for Multi-core Computers (by Dave and collabs)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772110000362)
