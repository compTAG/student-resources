# Welcome to CompTaG!

Welcome to the Computational Topology and Geometry (CompTaG) research group at
Montana State University! We are very excited to have you joining us! Below
you will find a variety of resources that will help you learn about the team
and become prepared to begin making contributions!

## Logistics

### Meeting Location
We currently meet at Faculty Court #23 (FC23). To obtain a
key for FC23, contact Suzie Hockel or Brittany Fasy. FC23 is located at the
center of the red target in the map at the bottom of this page.  (At this time,
keys are not given to undergraduate students.  However, undergraduates are
welcome to work at FC23).

### Weekly Meetings
See slack for the updated meeitng times.  We have a one hour research seminar
year-round, and a summer weekly book club.  In addition, we schedule
prove-a-thons, which is a common time to work on research problems.

## Onboarding Tasks

1. [Slack](https://alice-storytelling.slack.com/home): Most of the
   communication between team members occurs on Slack, which is a team
   collaboration software. Both web and mobile versions are available, and we
   encourage that you install Slack on your smartphone if possible. To be added
   to our Slack group, use the following link:
   [Slack-link](https://join.slack.com/t/tda-at-msu/shared_invite/enQtMjk4NDIwMjY2MDY2LTNhYTYwOWRjNWM3ZGU2MzdlODFkOTA5MzNiNTFmMDQyZTc2NzkxNGNjMjlmZGFjZGZlNmEyYTE2MjBhMGFhMjE).

2. GIT: if you are not yet familiar with git (or need a refresher), please take
   the GIT Udacity course:
    [Git Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

3. Reading: To get started in the filed, please see the Introductory Readings
   for Topics sections of
   [README](https://github.com/compTAG/student-resources#introductory-readings-for-topics)
   page.
    * Persistent Homology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bnG1Wavag&amp;t=16s 
    * Topological Data Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOZN3XZdoO0
    * Network Comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuTHBkyLJ1k

4. Code: Papers (even theoretical ones) typically have an experimental section,
   which means that you should be comfortable running some code!  Dionysus is a python 
   package that will be helpful in finding persistence diagrams and using Rips complex. 
   Here's a tutorial of the library features: https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/tutorial.html

5. TeamPapers: Our team has authored several papers that we encourage you to read in order to learn more about our work: 
    * Shape Reconstruction: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10716
    * Analyzing Data on Road Networks: http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~carola/research/roadNetworkData.html
    * R Package TDA: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDA/index.html
