# Welcome to CompTaG!

Welcome to the Computational Topology and Geometry (CompTaG) research group at
Montana State University! We are very excited to have you joining us! Below
you will find a variety of resources that will help you learn about the team
and become prepared to begin making contributions!

## Logistics

We have a one hour research seminar and writing workshops year-round, and a
summer weekly book club.  In addition, we schedule prove-a-thons, which is a
common time to work on research problems.  See slack for the updated meeitng
times. 

## Onboarding Tasks

1. Faculty Court 23. Our main meeting location isFaculty Court #23 (FC23).
   Graduate students can obtain a key by contacting Brittany.
   Snacks and sodas are available on an honor system cash payment in the
   kitchen.

2. [Slack](https://tda-at-msu.slack.com/home): Most of the
   communication between team members occurs on Slack, which is a team
   collaboration software. Both web and mobile versions are available, and we
   encourage that you install Slack on your smartphone if possible. To be added
   to our Slack group, please ask Brittany for the invitation link.

    * Post a message to #general to introduce yourself to the group!
    * Click on the word `Channels` and take a look through the many channels we
      have discussion various projects.  Feel free to join any conversations that seem
      interesting to you.

3. GIT: if you are not yet familiar with git (or need a refresher), please take
   the GIT Udacity course:
    [Git Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
    or use the desktop learning app [Git-it](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/git-it).

4. [CITI Training](http://www.montana.edu/orc/training/citi/index.html) You will
   need to complete Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)
   training.  Please complete these trainings, then  post a message on Slack to
   Brittany and David to let them know the dates that you have completed these
   modules. This should be done within 30 days of joining this team.
   Specifically, you will need to complete:
    - All students in CompTaG should complete: a 
      Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) module. Once complete, please ping
      Brittany on slack, and upload your certificate to the [CompTaG SP Folder](https://montanaedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/n12v755_msu_montana_edu/Documents/COMPTAG/granting/RCR?csf=1&web=1&e=DIOAiu).
    - If you help with outreach events and/or use human-subject data (e.g.,
      Twitter data, GPS trajectories), you will additionally need to complete
      Human Subjects Research -  Social and Behavioral Research. 

4. Videos: To get started working in CompTaG research, please see the Introductory Readings
   and Videos for Topics sections of
   [README](https://github.com/compTAG/student-resources#introductory-readings-for-topics)
   page.  For a crash course on some specific topics, watch these videos:

    * Group theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4plQ5ppg9c&list=PLAvgI3H-gclb_Xy7eTIXkkKt3KlV6gk9_
    * Persistent Homology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bnG1Wavag&amp;t=16s
    * Topological Data Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOZN3XZdoO0
    * Computational Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuTHBkyLJ1k

5. Code: Papers (even theoretical ones) typically have an experimental section,
   which means that you should be comfortable running some code!  To get started, complete the following tasks:

    * If you don't have a strong background in CS / programming, we recommend
      taking a coursera course, such as [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/)
    * Compute persistent homology of a triangle using [Dionysus](https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/)
    * Compute a Delaunay triangulation in  [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), and
     output the triangulation data structure.
    * Learn how to use the R TDA Package.
    * Complete the Hyalite training. Hyalite is the research computing cluster
      on campus. To schedule a training, please email Research Cyberinfrastructure
      at hyalite-support@montana.edu and copy Brittany on that email.

6. Team Papers: Our team has authored several papers that we encourage you to read in order to learn more about our work.  Write a short summary of the _problem_ beling addressed in each of the following papers (and post it in your perosnal git repo).
    
    * [Searching in the space of persistence diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11257)
    * [PHT-based reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12759)
    * [Fast randomized point location without preprocessing in two-and three-dimensional Delaunay triangulations (by Binhai and collabs)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772198000352)
    * [On the Bootstrap for Persistence Diagrams and Landscapes (by Brittany and collabs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0376)
    * [Parallel Geometric Algorithms for Multi-core Computers (by Dave and collabs)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772110000362)

7. Other Resources

    * [SP Folder](https://montanaedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/n12v755_msu_montana_edu/Documents/COMPTAG?csf=1&web=1&e=eEzXcy):
        this box folder contains miscelaneous files, such as sample USP or GRFP
        proposals.  If you need access, just ask Brittany.
