# How to Book Club

Book club has two goals:

1. To give you and your colleagues an opportunity to learn new tools and skills.
   Leaning material in a vacuum can be slow and time consuming, but if you learn
   with others, you can ingest the material more quickly.

2. Practice presenting. You will give many presentations in your academic
   career.  It is best to get some practice when you can.  The book club gives
   you a low stress opportunity to try things out different presentation
   techniques to see what does and what does not work.

## For all Book Club members

Read (or at the very least skim) the section that is under discussion.  Try to
bring one or two questions or thoughts that can help improve the discussion.
Trying to come up with a few questions will help you be more engaged with the
material. Often, when reading through a book, it is necessary to draw out
examples for yourself and to solve exercises that the authors provide. Attempt
them.

After the meeting, send the presenters one up / one down feedback.  Remember,
this should be constructive criticism.

## For Presenters

Your goal is to lead a discussion, which is way more fun than just a lecture.
You should try to go beyond the content.  What we sometimes call, "adding a
plus-one".  A few ways to add a plus-one is:

* Each section of the book has a "main point".  Work though a few examples that
  use the "main point".  Examples (and sometimes non-examples) are what we can
  sink our teeth into, and are helpful for our understanding.
* Add in details of omitted or hand-waved steps. Often, the author points these
  out as an exercise to the reader.
* It's always good to know historical context. So, go to the primary sources to
  see full proofs, or perhaps more context. Is there something helpful in the
  primary source that was not in the reading?

Often, we pair you up for leading discussions.  The pairing is to allow you and
your partner to work together to make a plan for leading the discussion.  Note
that it is a way easier to come up with a plan if you have someone to discuss
with.  Often, you will find that the discussion will help you come up with an
idea that neither of you would have figured on your own.

### To prepare for the book discussion:

1. Start early.  Skim the section that you will cover and have a quick
   discussion to make sure you know the "main point" of the section.

2. Brainstorm a few ways to add a plus one.  What can you present to make it
   worthwhile to come to book club, and not read it by oneself?

3. Individually, go and explore details.

4. About two days before, send out a reminder of the topics that will be
   covered.  The reminder may help attendees look over the material if they
   have forgotten to do so.

### When leading the book discussion:

1. Take note of those in attendance or assign this task to another CompTaG
   member (you will use your list to ask for feedback
   later)

2. Embrace the questions!  Some you are prepared for, but some you might not
   have thought about yet.  Feel free to take a second to think or to ask for a
   clarification.  If you still don't know the answer, either open it up for
   discussion or ask to table that question until the end or start a thread
   about it on slack.

3. Enjoy the benefit of your hard work and preparation!

### After the book discussion:

Continuous improvement is the best way to improve your communication skills.
One way to improve is to solicit feedback.  After you present:

1. Post a reminder to those in attendance to ask for one-up one-down feedback.

2. Thank each person that gives you feedback and follow up with them on any
   questions that you have about how you can improve.  And, if there was
   anything particulalry helpful that you think everyone will beenfit from,
   post in #technical or #book-club (or whatever channel seems most
   appropriate).

3. Follow up with any additional questions, todos, or content postings that may
   have arose during the discussion.
