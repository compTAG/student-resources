# How to Seminar

Seminar has three goals:

1. To learn about recent research.

2. To start research conversations, and potentially tackle open problems.

3. Practice presenting. You will give many presentations in your academic
   career.  It is best to get some practice when you can, and seminar is a safe
   space to do so.  Please be respectful of preesnters and responsive to
   constructive criticism.

## For all seminar attendees

If the presenters post something to read before the seminar, please read (or at
least skim) the material that they post.  Try to bring one or two questions or
thoughts that can help improve the discussion.  Being familiar with the material
before the seminar starts will help you be more engaged with the presentation.

After the meeting, send the presenters one up / one down feedback.  This can be
sent as a DM on slack.

* One up: let the presenter know what you think they did well, and why.  This
  will help encourage them to continue those good presentations skills.
* One down: let the presenter know one way that they could improve the
  presentation.  Rather than give the negative "you did this wrong", form your
  feedback in a constructive way.  Stay positive, even when giving negative
  feedback. More bees with honey, they say.

## For Presenters

Your goal is to lead a discussion, which is way more fun than just a lecture /
standard presentation. The seminar changes form each semester, but some
different formats that we have are:

* Presenting recent research (not your own): Please post to slack the paper that
  you will present two to three days before your presentation. This gives others
  the chance to take a look at it before the seminar.  Typically paper
  presentations take three weeks, with the first week focusd on giving the
  background, the second week on the paper (or a specific section of the paper),
  and the third week on "what next" or maybe more details on the paper.
* Research updates.  When we do research updates, typically 2-3 students present
  in one session.  If you need help with or feedback on something, these
  seminars are good places to solicit that help/feedback.
* Working on open problems.  Here, it is important that the leaders help quickly
  structure the working groups so that the majority of the time can be spent in
  the working groups.
* A practice presentation.  Before beginning your presentation, let us know
  where you are presenting, who the audience is, and anything you want us to
  focus on.  After you give your talk, we will all discuss first our overall
  impressions, then specific feedback for improvement.

Often, we pair you up for leading discussions.  The pairing is to allow you and
your partner to work together to make a plan for leading the discussion.  Note
that it is a way easier to come up with a plan if you have someone to discuss
with.  Often, you will find that the discussion will help you come up with an
idea that neither of you would have figured on your own.

### To prepare for seminar:

1. Start early.  Do some reading (of the paper, of background materials), and
   plan what you want to present.

2. Individually, go and explore details.

3. If multiple people are presenting, try to meet at least once before
   presenting together.

4. About two days before, send out a reminder of the topics that will be
   covered, and if you expect participants to do anything beforehand.

### When leading the discussion at seminar:

1. Take note of those in attendance or assign this task to another CompTaG
   member (you will use your list to ask for feedback
   later)

2. Embrace the questions!  Some you are prepared for, but some you might not
   have thought about yet.  Feel free to take a second to think or to ask for a
   clarification.  If you still don't know the answer, either open it up for
   discussion or ask to table that question until the end or slack.

3. Enjoy the benefit of your hard work and preparation!

### After seminar

1. Post a reminder to those in attendance to ask for one-up one-down feedback.

2. Thank each person that gives you feedback and follow up with them on any
   questions that you have about how you can improve.

3. Follow up with any additional questions, todos, or content postings that may
   have arose during the discussion.
